# 🎓 MS SQL Server DBMS Learning Project

Welcome to my complete hands-on learning journey for Microsoft SQL Server DBMS.  
This project covers **theory**, **practicals**, **screenshots**, **queries**, and **project files** — everything documented step-by-step for future reference, resume, and interviews.
